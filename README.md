# Weather-viewing App 

# Description

This app allows users to view the current weather in their current location. The base functional specifications include Start up and Exit, and Local Weather View. Our additional component specifications include Short-term Forecast, Long-term Forecast, and Weather on Mars.

 It connects to openweathermap.org’s <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api">API</a> and it is developed in Java with a Swing graphical user interface. The weather data is gathered in JSON format.

For advanced image processing you will need one or several of these packages. For instance using the method ``clip.resize`` requires that at least one of Scipy, PIL, Pillow or OpenCV are installed.

- The Python Imaging Library (PIL) or, better, its branch Pillow_ .
- Scipy_ (for tracking, segmenting, etc.), and can be used for resizing video clips if PIL and OpenCV aren't installed on your computer.
- `Scikit Image`_ may be needed for some advanced image manipulation.
- `OpenCV 2.4.6`_ or more recent (which provides the package ``cv2``) may be needed for some advanced image manipulation.
